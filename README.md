  <h2>Currently Learning</h2>
  <p>
    I am actively developing my skills in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong> to deepen my understanding of data analysis, automation, and revenue operations. 
    Through hands-on projects, I am practicing writing complex SQL queries including joins, aggregations, and window functions, as well as building Python scripts for data manipulation and problem-solving.
  </p>
  <p>
    My focus is on applying these technical skills to real-world business scenarios such as billing analytics, operational reporting, corss-department functionality, and performance tracking. 
    As I continue learning, I am building projects that demonstrate data-driven thinking and practical application of both languages.
